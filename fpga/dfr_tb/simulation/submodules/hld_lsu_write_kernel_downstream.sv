// This module is used by the write LSU to release valids to kernel downstream when writeack arrives. It monitors the outputs from the unaligned controller to
// determine how many completed kernel words have been packed into each memory word. Once the memory word is finished, the corresponding number of kernel words
// this memory word contains is written to a fifo. Upon receiving writeack, read from this fifo, the read data indicates how many non-predicated valids are
// allowed to be released to kernel downstream. This module also controls the read side of the predicate fifo, a predicated transaction has no corresponding
// writeack and is allowed to be released to kernel downstream if there are no valids ahead of it.
//
// For additional info, refer to hld_global_load_store.sv (top module of entire LSU) and hld_lsu.sv (top module of the core LSU).
