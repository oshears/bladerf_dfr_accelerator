//  This is the top-level module for the feature-based LSU (load store unit). Unlike previous LSU implementations in which the implementation defined the features and    //
//  the compiler had to choose the best implementation for the desired features, this LSU allows one to select the features and the implementation just deals with it.    //
//                                                                                                                                                                        //
//  This LSU was optimized for high latency stallable memory access. It will function properly with low latency and/or non-stallable memory, however there are other      //
//  implementations which use significantly less area for that use case.                                                                                                  //
//                                                                                                                                                                        //
//  This module is a wrapper around the core LSU itself, and the following features are provided in this wrapper:                                                         //
//  1. Optional width adaption between the kernel data path width and the core LSU's kernel data width                                                                    //
//       - this enables the kernel width to be arbitrarily larger than the memory width, this feature is necessary if kernel width > 2 * memory width since the core      //
//         LSU can only handle one kernel word spanning up to 3 memory words                                                                                              //
//       - even if kernel width is not that wide, may still want this feature to save area at the expense of throughput                                                   //
//  2. Optional width adaption between the memory data path width and the core LSU's memory data width                                                                    //
//       - one can save lots of area by narrowing the typically wide fifos at the memory interface, this may result in some throughput loss although it should be small   //
//         if the kernel width is significantly smaller than the memory width, beware that                                                                                //
//       - burst coalescing will be disabled if memory width adaption is used, supporting both burst coalescing and memory width adaption requires the wide fifos that    //
//         we were trying to remove in the first place by using width adaption                                                                                            //
//       - memory width adaption results in inefficient use of memory bandwidth, e.g. if the core LSU readdata is one quarter the width of the memory readdata, then      //
//         three quarters of the data read is discarded and only one quarter of the readdata is returned to the core LSU                                                  //
//  3. Optional cache, only for read LSU                                                                                                                                  //
//       - this is a bump-in-the-wire between the core LSU memory interface and the actual memory interface, there must be a positive edge on the i_flush_cache signal    //
//         every time the contents of memory can change, typically this is every time a kernel starts                                                                     //
//       - the cache data width is a memory word, if memory width adaption is used then the cache shares the same memory width as the core LSU                            //
//       - cache is most beneficial when the access pattern reuses data that was read recently, cache hits mean less demand on global memory bandwidth (free it up for    //
//         other LSUs in the system) and the kernel data path will have lower latency (possibly useful if the nature of the design prevents lots of outstanding           //
//         transactions to global memory), obviously this comes at an expense of increased area, both registers and M20K                                                  //
//  4. Allow valids to be released to kernel downstream before the corresponding writeack                                                                                 //
//       - this has no effect on o_active (which must deassert before declaring the kernel is done) and has no effect on the core LSU                                     //
//       - this feature is implemented for legacy reasons, if there is no dependency on the data written then the compiler should connect stall/valid (or stall latency)  //
//         around the LSU instead of through the LSU, e.g the LSU's kernel downstream interface should be dangling with i_stall=0 and o_vaild ignored, unfortunately      //
//         there are cases where the compiler is still wiring the stall/valid handshaking through the LSU, so this wrapper implements the shortcut                        //
//                                                                                                                                                                        //
//  The features of the core LSU itself are described the comments at the beginning of hld_lsu.sv.                                                                        //
