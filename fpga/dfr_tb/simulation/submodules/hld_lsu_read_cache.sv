// This is the cache module for the read LSU. The cache lives outside of the core LSU. It is a bump-in-the-wire architecture which sits between the LSU avalon interface and
// the actual memory interface. There is no snoop on writes to memory, so to be functionally correct the read LSU can only access data that is not being modified during the
// read access. Two scenarios (among others) that satisfy this are:
// 1. read-only access to some region of global memory
// 2. all reads finish before any writes start to this region of global memory
//
// The contents of memory can change between different runs of the same hardware, therefore one must drive the i_flush_cache signal any time the contents of memory have changed
// (more specifically the contents in the region memory that this read LSU may access). Typically the i_flush_cache signal is asserted high for one clock cycle at the beginning
// of each opencl kernel execution. The valid marker for each cache line is stored in memory (not registers), so the cache must walk through all memory addresses in order to
// flush the cache. During this time the cache is still operational, e.g. backpressure is not applied to the LSU, however all cache lookups are treated as a cache miss, and
// the cache does not update with data read from global memory.
//
// Currently there is no hash function to map byte address in global memory to cache lines (although the cache architecture certainly supports such future enhancements).
// Instead the address is sliced up. Let's use some real numbers to make the explanation easier. Suppose global memory is 64 bytes wide, so the bottom 6 bits of the byte address
// indicate a location within a memory word. Suppose the cache depth is 1024 memory words, so bits [15:6] of the byte address indicate the cache line number. This means byte
// address 0 and byte address 65536 both map to cache line 0. To tell them apart, inside each cache line, the upper bits of the byte address (bits 16+) are stored so that we
// can infer which byte address the data is for.
//
// The operation of the cache is as follows:
// 1. (Optional) Split avalon read bursts coming from the LSU, but really the LSU should disable burst coalescing
// 2. Read from the cache to check for hit or miss, keep track of the result in the hit fifo
// 3a. If there is a cache hit, push the data into the hit fifo, skip to step 5
// 3b. Otherwise it was a cache miss, request data from global memory (there is an optional bump-in-the-wire burst coalescer here)
// 4b. When data is returned from memory, push it into the rsp fifo and update the cache (but don't read from the cache again)
// 5. The hit fifo indicates whether the read data returned to the LSU should come from the hit fifo or the rsp fifo
//
// Some important observations:
// - each LSU read request (assume no bursts) results in exactly one read from the cache
// - if cache hit need to grab the data now, may be stalled from returning read data to LSU due to an earlier miss, and if we read the cache later the contents could have changed
// - not required to update cache with read data from global memory, it doesn't help the current cache miss, it may only help a future request to the same address
//
// Joint optimization with the read LSU:
// 1. Inside the LSU's burst coalescer, can bypass avm_ctrl_fifo
//    - read LSU has a throttle to not ask for more data that it has space for
//    - all fifos inside the cache are sized at least this deep, therefore cache will never backpressure the LSU, throttle will engage first to stop sending to the cache
//    - therefore there is no backpressure, e.g. avm_waitrequest from the cache to LSU would always be 0
// 2. Inside the LSU's read data alignment, can bypass avm_rd_data_fifo
//    - this fifo was only needed because avm_readdatavalid has no backpressure mechanism
//    - the read data returned from cache to LSU comes from either the hit fifo or rsp fifo, and the selection is gated by the order fifo, therefore read data is backpressureable
//
// Future extension: enable snoop on writes to invalidate cache
// - currently the cache is implemented with 1 write and 1 read port
// - if we had a memory with 2 write and 2 read ports, we could enable snoop on write without changing anything else in the cache
// - the extra read port would check if a snooped write was in the cache
// - the extra write port would update or invalidate that cache line if the snooped write was in the cache
// - notice the if snooped writes results in cache line invalidation, then we only need the quad port memory for the valid and upper address bits, this is a narrow memory so
//   replicating memory for extra ports is not so expensive
//
